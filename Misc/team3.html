<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

	<p>I think social media, like a gun, is only 100% ethical in a perfect society. However, when you place social media in the real world – where there are those who will harm others to get what they want – social media has some risks and raises some concerns. On the political side of things, there is the risk that people with political motives such as news agencies or political parties will use it to spread lies and misinformation to the public. However, there is the potential for good – for people to spread the truth and shut down this misinformation. Social media is just a tool. A tool that can be used to do good or used to cause great harm.</p>

	<p>There is the concern of non-benign agencies having outreach to younger audiences, influencing their political views at a time when they are uneducated, naïve, easily trusting and impressionable. Children of all ages can easily access social media, despite age restrictions, and ‘brain wash’ them into believing all sorts of things.</p>

		<p>The idea of social media, where people can share things online to people all over the world is great – so long as none of the users abuse this. When the users do abuse this, social media has negative effects. Fortunately this is combatted by the social companies themselves moderating what happens on their platform. However, what happens when the social media company themselves is the non-benign agency. The platform has all the power (to an extent) and if they are the ones trying to spread misinformation or ‘brain wash’ the youth, we may not even realise it until it is too late (if ever).</p>


		<p>There are definitely some ethical issues relating to the misuse and abuse of social media but I personally feel that it is worth the risk. Like all tools that are only dangerous when abused, I feel that it is up to society to make sure that social media is a tool used for good and not for bad. The good that can come out of social media – education, support, awareness – outweighs the negative so long as society does not let the negatives grow too large, too heavy.</p>
