<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p><em>Anonymity online is a large ethical issue, should you be able to say and do things online without people knowing you? Should you be held responsible for every action on social media? I strongly believe in freedom of speech and the protection of the rights of an individual, particularly the right to remain anonymous online. Speaking anonymously is to speak freely, with how large social media has gotten and the power it has we are now seeing social media companies hide or supress political beliefs. I am strongly against this, I believe in the rights of the individual to express their opinion, no matter how taboo or outrageous it may be, censorship should not be placed on the internet or social media.</em><br>
<p><em>As for echo chambers and misinformation, I believe echo chambers to be bad for the internet and for society, the radicalizing of a person’s beliefs into something dangerous is not good for politics or social media. But I do not believe in shutting down these echo chambers, just doing the best to educate an inform people who are in them, in no way should they be censored or banned. It is up to the social media user to seek out and check what kind of information they are looking at, I do not believe in a social media companies’ ability to ‘fact check’ news, users should be diligent and do their own research into matters instead of relying on companies to get it right. When those companies could be serving a particular agenda and seeking to remove content that goes against this agenda.</em><br>
