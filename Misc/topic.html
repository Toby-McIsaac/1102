<!-- Main content -->
<p>Our chosen topic is the impact of social media on politics and society, social media is a huge part of todays digital world and is being used more for politics as time progresses. Social media is often used as a tool for political or financial gain, and it is important to take note of the growing number of opportunities, risks and choices made available by the prevalence of social media. Social mediaâ€™s large presence makes it the quickest way to get information out, the faster information can spread the more can be gained or lost. Due to these reasons social media can have a profound impact on politics, political parties and the opinions of people or nations.</p>
