<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

<h2>Fact Checking</h2> 
<p>With more and more people on social media following accounts that talk about politics and important life matters, people are starting to get their political views and information on very important matters from social media. The problem with this, is that almost anyone can say something online and claim it’s the truth. People are likely to believe what they read on the internet if it is confirming what they agree. They won’t fact check their facts and this lie will reinforce their false belief (Fujimoto, 2020, p. xx). Even worse, if someone with power, status and/or credibility presents a statement as fact, when in reality it is not, people are likely to believe them regardless of they believe. Lastly, if heaps of people are sharing information on social media, it must be factual...right? Wrong, obviously. However, this is unfortunately another contributing factor in people believing fake news.  

There is an obvious solution to this problem – fact checking. All someone needs to do is to research the topic and read multiple creditable sources. That is the issue though, today people are often lazy and do not bother. If they want to be up to date with the news, they can only read 3-4 lines at most in the middle of their busy schedule.  

The question now changes to this - if the individual wont fact check the information, who will? It just so happens that several big social media companies have started to use an effective (but not perfect) solution to this problem – fact checking AI. When a user posts something, an AI can tell if the information inside the post is false. They often supply sources to gain further factual information. So, with all this fake news out there - is it time we normalise social medias utilising fact checking AI?

<h2>Free speech laws</h2>

<p>Another question to ask is if we should do a complete overhaul of the laws surrounding social media – free speech in particular. Online, people can say whatever they want and remain almost completely anonymous. It is easy to harass and can be hard to stop or prevent. There can be serious harm done to both individuals and the masses. Maybe we need to reconsider if we should allow for the current level of freedom that we do? Should there be restrictions in place based on the age of the person speaking/being spoken to? Restrictions on what can be said publicly vs privately? Obviously many social medias have rules in place to combat some of these things but should it be law that they need to be stricter? Or, perhaps, less strict? 

Free speech is a good concept – the ability to express ones self is a human right. But of course, it has to be restricted somewhat. You can’t be expected to say death threats and bully relentlessly and just get away with it. We already have laws that impede on “true free speech” - yet we still say that most “western” countries have free speech.  

Social media is a relatively new concept, only a couple decades old. This means that we haven’t had much time to figure out what good laws are surrounding social media. Free speech is a difficult thing to restrict as it’s a fine line between making things safe and oppressing society or the individual. Many people that are needlessly bullied, harassed or put in danger from what people say on social media (either directly or indirectly) could be saved from tighter restrictions.

<h2>Youth Education</h2>

<p>Lastly, a way to reduce the amount of danger that social media poses to society is to better educate the youth on how social media can impact their political views. The youth of society spend the most time on social media and are the ones that will grow up to create the future of social media. It could be a good idea to spend time teaching young people about how social media can influence their political views without them even realising it. Things like filters that show only certain posts based on what you like which can result in echo chambers that push you further towards the extreme ends of the political spectrum.  

They could also learn about the good things on social media to do with politics – like learning from people in other countries who have experienced different political climates first-hand. They can meet people of similar views to find friends or people with different views to help educate themselves and understand how others think. With almost every bad thing there is to learn about social media, there is another half that is good and beneficial. All of the opportunities of social media have their counterpart risk.  

Education for the youth would allow them to make the correct decisions and maximise the reward whilst minimising the risk. The question of course for those in charge is whether or not it is worth replacing something in the education curriculum with this information. It is something that the children of my generation have had to learn for themselves and it is up for debate if we have done a good job or not.
