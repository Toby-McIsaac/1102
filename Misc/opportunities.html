<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Before the internet, people only had consistent contact with the people that lived close to them and the only news they got from other countries was the newspaper or expensive phone calls. Now, we can talk to almost anyone else, anywhere in the world for very low costs. The way people get their information has changed from newspapers and television - which were controlled by powerful people and organisations who dictated what got shown - to the internet where anyone can make a post on a social media platform which could be seen by millions of other users. These users in turn, share it with the people they are connected to and before the end of the day, the information has reached half the globe. This means that we have an additional way to combat political corruption and expose the truth. When information is discovered by someone, no matter how insignificant they are, it can be seen by millions within a minute.

A great side effect of the speed that information can travel is that it’s far harder to cover up mistakes and bad deeds for those with the power and motive to so because, by the time someone tries to suppress the information, it has already been shared around the internet and has been seen by thousands, if not millions of people. It has been recorded in a database, screenshot and stored on a hard drive or tucked away in the memories of people in all corners of the world. This means that it is far harder for powerful people to avoid the consequences of their actions, decentivising them taking actions that have negative consequences in the first place and helps keep those actions in the public eye.

Howard Rheingold, an american writer, critic and teacher who specialises in the cultural, social and political implications of modern communication media said "The political significance of computer mediated communication lies in its capacity to challenge the existing political hierarchy’s monopoly on powerful communications media, and perhaps thus revitalize citizen-based democracy."

Social media gives users the opportunity to communicate with other people that they normally wouldn’t be able to due to social pressures or because they simply lived too far away from each other. The people they meet on these platforms could share their worldview and affirm their beliefs. Others, even on the same platform, could hold differing opinions and challenge their worldview, giving them the opportunity to think more in-depth about what they believe and evaluate whether or not these beliefs hold up to scrutiny.

The connectivity provided by social media platforms gives users the opportunity to set up grassroots campaigns, collective action at a community level, in order to make petitions or organise protests with the goal of changing, adding or removing laws.

These days, there are more people using social media than watching television. This means that when a political party wants to broadcast a speech or announcement, doing so on social media would reach more people and viewers could share it with others far easier than if it was broadcast on television. It is also far cheaper to advertise on social media compared to booking time-slots from a television station, which have to be organised a week in advance at least and can cost thousands of dollars to air often enough for enough people to see it. The fact that social media advertising is much cheaper that more conventional platforms allows smaller parties the opportunity to be on far more equal footing with larger, more wealthy parties because they aren’t limited by having to pay for advertising campaigns.

Both announcement and advertisement can be more effective on social media because the users on the platform can comment on posts and give their feedback directly after they watch or read them. This gives the political parties that are posting these the opportunity to change how they go about presenting themselves to the public in order to increase their popularity and improve their chances when it comes time for the public to vote on an issue or select leaders.

US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s posts on Instagram show how social media can be used by politicians to provide updates to the people. These constant updates help that person stay relevant and in the public eye. The more personal feeling of these updates, as opposed to the formal setting of a press conference or interview, make the politician feel more relatable and authentic.
