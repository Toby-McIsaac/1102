<p>
I think that, overall, social media has had a negative impact on politics and how it’s done. The fact that it is far too easy to post incorrect information on a social media platform, combined with a lot of people blindly believing anything that fits what they already think is true and discarding anything that doesn’t, means that the freedom of information and communication provided by social media platforms is entirely overshadowed by the users on those platforms falling headfirst into their biases.<br><br/> 

This unwillingness from a lot of people to do even the most basic research exposes one of the biggest weaknesses of democracy, it requires an educated population to work effectively, and with surprisingly few people being willing to educate themselves, the democratic process can easily be corrupted by those willing to take advantage of people fears and biases.
