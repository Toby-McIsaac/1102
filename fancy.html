    <p>Our chosen topic is the impact of social media on politics and society, social media is a huge part of todays digital world and is being used more for politics as time progresses. Social media is often used as a tool for political or financial gain, and it is important to take note of the growing number of opportunities, risks and choices made available by the prevalence of social media. Social media’s large presence makes it the quickest way to get information out, the faster information can spread the more can be gained or lost. Due to these reasons social media can have a profound impact on politics, political parties and the opinions of people or nations.</p>

<h2>Increased Connectivity and Freedom of Information</h2>    
Social media gives users the opportunity to communicate with other people that they normally wouldn’t be able to due to social pressures or because they simply lived too far away from each other. The people they meet on these platforms could share their worldview and affirm their beliefs. Others, even on the same platform, could hold differing opinions and challenge their worldview, giving them the opportunity to think more in-depth about what they believe and evaluate whether or not these beliefs hold up to scrutiny.<br/><br/>
Before the internet, people only had consistent contact with the people that lived close to them and the only news they got from other countries was the newspaper or expensive phone calls. Now, we can talk to almost anyone else, anywhere in the world for very low costs. The way people get their information has changed from newspapers and television - which were controlled by powerful people and organisations who dictated what got shown - to the internet where anyone can make a post on a social media platform which could be seen by millions of other users. These users in turn, share it with the people they are connected to and before the end of the day, the information has reached half the globe. This means that we have an additional way to combat political corruption and expose the truth. When information is discovered by someone, no matter how insignificant they are, it can be seen by millions within a minute.<br/><br/>
A great side effect of the speed that information can travel is that it’s far harder to cover up mistakes and bad deeds for those with the power and motive to so because, by the time someone tries to suppress the information, it has already been shared around the internet and has been seen by thousands, if not millions of people. It has been recorded in a database, screenshot and stored on a hard drive or tucked away in the memories of people in all corners of the world. This means that it is far harder for powerful people to avoid the consequences of their actions, decentivising them taking actions that have negative consequences in the first place and helps keep those actions in the public eye.<br/><br/>
The connectivity provided by social media platforms gives users the opportunity to set up grassroots campaigns, collective action at a community level, in order to make petitions or organise protests with the goal of changing, adding or removing laws.<br/><br/>
Howard Rheingold, an american writer, critic and teacher who specialises in the cultural, social and political implications of modern communication media said "The political significance of computer mediated communication lies in its capacity to challenge the existing political hierarchy’s monopoly on powerful communications media, and perhaps thus revitalize citizen-based democracy."<br/><br/>
</p>

<h2>Political Campaigning, Announcements and Updates</h2>
<p>These days, there are more people using social media than watching television. This means that when a political party wants to broadcast a speech or announcement, doing so on social media would reach more people and viewers could share it with others far easier than if it was broadcast on television. It is also far cheaper to advertise on social media compared to booking time-slots from a television station, which have to be organised a week in advance at least and can cost thousands of dollars to air often enough for enough people to see it. The fact that social media advertising is much cheaper than more conventional platforms allows smaller parties the opportunity to be on far more equal footing with larger, more wealthy parties because they aren’t limited by having to pay for advertising campaigns.<br/><br/>

Both announcement and advertisement can be more effective on social media because the users on the platform can comment on posts and give their feedback directly after they watch or read them. This gives the political parties that are posting these the opportunity to change how they go about presenting themselves to the public in order to increase their popularity and improve their chances when it comes time for the public to vote on an issue or select leaders.<br/><br/>

US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s posts on Instagram show how social media can be used by politicians to provide updates to the people. These constant updates help that person stay relevant and in the public eye. The more personal feeling of these updates, as opposed to the formal setting of a press conference or interview, make the politician feel more relatable and authentic.<br/><br/>

      <h3 class="w3-text-light-grey">Fact Checking</h2> 
      <p>With more and more people on social media following accounts that talk about politics and important life matters, people are starting to get their political views and information on very important matters from social media. The problem with this, is that almost anyone can say something online and claim it’s the truth. People are likely to believe what they read on the internet if it is confirming what they agree. They won’t fact check their facts and this lie will reinforce their false belief (Fujimoto, 2020, p. xx). Even worse, if someone with power, status and/or credibility presents a statement as fact, when in reality it is not, people are likely to believe them regardless of they believe. Lastly, if heaps of people are sharing information on social media, it must be factual...right? Wrong, obviously. However, this is unfortunately another contributing factor in people believing fake news.  

      There is an obvious solution to this problem – fact checking. All someone needs to do is to research the topic and read multiple creditable sources. That is the issue though, today people are often lazy and do not bother. If they want to be up to date with the news, they can only read 3-4 lines at most in the middle of their busy schedule.  

      The question now changes to this - if the individual wont fact check the information, who will? It just so happens that several big social media companies have started to use an effective (but not perfect) solution to this problem – fact checking AI. When a user posts something, an AI can tell if the information inside the post is false. They often supply sources to gain further factual information. So, with all this fake news out there - is it time we normalise social medias utilising fact checking AI?  

      </p>

      <h3 class="w3-text-light-grey">Free speech laws</h2>

      <p>Another question to ask is if we should do a complete overhaul of the laws surrounding social media – free speech in particular. Online, people can say whatever they want and remain almost completely anonymous. It is easy to harass and can be hard to stop or prevent. There can be serious harm done to both individuals and the masses. Maybe we need to reconsider if we should allow for the current level of freedom that we do? Should there be restrictions in place based on the age of the person speaking/being spoken to? Restrictions on what can be said publicly vs privately? Obviously many social medias have rules in place to combat some of these things but should it be law that they need to be stricter? Or, perhaps, less strict? 

      Free speech is a good concept – the ability to express ones self is a human right. But of course, it has to be restricted somewhat. You can’t be expected to say death threats and bully relentlessly and just get away with it. We already have laws that impede on “true free speech” - yet we still say that most “western” countries have free speech.  

      Social media is a relatively new concept, only a couple decades old. This means that we haven’t had much time to figure out what good laws are surrounding social media. Free speech is a difficult thing to restrict as it’s a fine line between making things safe and oppressing society or the individual. Many people that are needlessly bullied, harassed or put in danger from what people say on social media (either directly or indirectly) could be saved from tighter restrictions.   

      </p>

      <h3 class="w3-text-light-grey">Youth Education</h2>

      <p>Lastly, a way to reduce the amount of danger that social media poses to society is to better educate the youth on how social media can impact their political views. The youth of society spend the most time on social media and are the ones that will grow up to create the future of social media. It could be a good idea to spend time teaching young people about how social media can influence their political views without them even realising it. Things like filters that show only certain posts based on what you like which can result in echo chambers that push you further towards the extreme ends of the political spectrum.  

      They could also learn about the good things on social media to do with politics – like learning from people in other countries who have experienced different political climates first-hand. They can meet people of similar views to find friends or people with different views to help educate themselves and understand how others think. With almost every bad thing there is to learn about social media, there is another half that is good and beneficial. All of the opportunities of social media have their counterpart risk.  

      Education for the youth would allow them to make the correct decisions and maximise the reward whilst minimising the risk. The question of course for those in charge is whether or not it is worth replacing something in the education curriculum with this information. It is something that the children of my generation have had to learn for themselves and it is up for debate if we have done a good job or not.

	<p>I think social media, like a gun, is only 100% ethical in a perfect society. However, when you place social media in the real world – where there are those who will harm others to get what they want – social media has some risks and raises some concerns. On the political side of things, there is the risk that people with political motives such as news agencies or political parties will use it to spread lies and misinformation to the public. However, there is the potential for good – for people to spread the truth and shut down this misinformation. Social media is just a tool. A tool that can be used to do good or used to cause great harm.</p>

	<p>There is the concern of non-benign agencies having outreach to younger audiences, influencing their political views at a time when they are uneducated, naïve, easily trusting and impressionable. Children of all ages can easily access social media, despite age restrictions, and ‘brain wash’ them into believing all sorts of things.</p>

	<p>The idea of social media, where people can share things online to people all over the world is great – so long as none of the users abuse this. When the users do abuse this, social media has negative effects. Fortunately this is combatted by the social companies themselves moderating what happens on their platform. However, what happens when the social media company themselves is the non-benign agency. The platform has all the power (to an extent) and if they are the ones trying to spread misinformation or ‘brain wash’ the youth, we may not even realise it until it is too late (if ever).</p>


		<p>There are definitely some ethical issues relating to the misuse and abuse of social media but I personally feel that it is worth the risk. Like all tools that are only dangerous when abused, I feel that it is up to society to make sure that social media is a tool used for good and not for bad. The good that can come out of social media – education, support, awareness – outweighs the negative so long as society does not let the negatives grow too large, too heavy.</p>
